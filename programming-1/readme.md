*Author: Kunologist*

## Entry

The main content is in `main.ipynb`. Please refer to the instructions inside.

## Others

- The `images` folder contains both the output images and the images used in `main.ipynb`. 
- The `mat.mat` file is not used in `main.ipynb`, but is used for testing MATLAB usage for cross-comparison. It contains the convolved image using MATLAB's `conv2` function, with enough padding. Refer to `main.ipynb` for more details.
- `requirements.txt` lists the dependencies of the notebook.
- `main.html` is the exact HTML output of `main.ipynb`. It has certain visual defects, though.
